#How to run our pipeline

There is a inputamr.csv where we keep the existing sample data for senstivity tests.
outputamr.csv is a anitbiogram file created using script getbiogram.R from the inputamr.csv data.

We will also have additional scripts to convert any input data from the labs into our csv.
